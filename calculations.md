### Step 1: Data Collection

1. **Reed Switch**: Use a reed switch to detect when the door opens and closes.
2. **Timestamps**: When the door opens or closes, record the current timestamp along with the sunrise or sunset time, respectively, into the flash memory.

### Step 2: Data Retrieval

1. **Data Extraction**: Periodically extract the stored data from the flash memory for analysis.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any duplicate or erroneous entries.
2. **Data Sorting**: Sort the data by timestamp for easier analysis.

### Step 4: Data Analysis

1. **Calculate Deviations**: For each opening and closing event, calculate the deviation from the sunrise or sunset time. The deviation can be calculated as:

   ```
   Deviation = (Timestamp of door event) - (Sunrise/Sunset time)
   ```
2. **Calculate Mean Deviation**: Calculate the average deviation for both opening and closing events.

   ```
   Mean Deviation = Sum of all deviations / Number of events
   ```
3. **Calculate Tolerance**: Calculate the standard deviation or a fixed percentage of the mean deviation to set as a tolerance level.

   ```
   Tolerance = Standard Deviation of Deviations
   ```

### Step 5: Prediction and Notification

1. **Predict Next Event**: Use the mean deviation to predict the next opening or closing time.

   ```
   Predicted Time = Sunrise/Sunset time + Mean Deviation
   ```
2. **Check Against Tolerance**: If the door doesn't open or close within the predicted time +/- the tolerance, trigger a notification.

   ```
   if (Current Time > Predicted Time + Tolerance) or (Current Time < Predicted Time - Tolerance)
       Send Notification
   ```

### Step 6: Continuous Learning

1. **Update Mean and Tolerance**: Periodically update the mean deviation and tolerance based on new data to make the prediction more accurate.

### Step 7: Notification

1. **Notification**: Use a service like IFTTT Webhooks to send out a notification if the door didn't open or close as expected.
